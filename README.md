# Master Theorem Sample (JavaScript)
This is a simple App for usage and communicate with the Mercedes Benz One API. 

## The Problem

By solving a recurrence relation , it seems we can analyze the asymptotic run time of a recursive algorithm in the study of complexity theory in computer science <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_theorem_(analysis_of_algorithms)" title="Wikipedia: Master theorem (analysis of algorithms)">Master Theorem</a> (a.k.a. Master method). 

## The Application

This JavaScript app, automatically solves your given recurrence relation by applying the versatile. But it only supports polynomial or polylogarithmic functions
